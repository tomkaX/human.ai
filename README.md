### "Build AI like a human"



Can intelligent behaviors arise from a combination of simple ones? Can machines perceive the world the way humans do? I wanna show how built artificial senses, starting from simple voice detection and object permanence to more complex ones like gesture recognition and attention detection. Inspired by the way the human brain has a single algorithm for processing multiple senses, we show how we combined simple encoded inputs to perform higher-level reasoning.


Trained model on TensorFlow can recognize people and store relevant data about them-
personalized tasks and lists


*Alexa voice service* and amazon cloud - lambda.

*Intel Real Sence* camera for gesture recognition

data visualizatuon tools:
python packages
mathplotlib 
neo4j
